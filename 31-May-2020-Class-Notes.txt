What is an Environment of a Project ?

Why we need environments for project?

Who will create those environments?

Environment
-----------
To run our project we need infrastructure that is called as Environment of the project.

Machine with OS
Web/Application Server
Database Server etc..

For our application we need several environments like below

	1) DEV
	2) QA
	3) UAT
	4) Pilot
	5) Production (live env)

-> In company, these environments will be created by DevOps team.

-> We will use these environments to test our application

-> Developers will use DEV environment to perform Dev Integration Testing

-> Testers will use QA environment to perform Software Testing

-> Client/Client side team members will use UAT environment to perform acceptance testing

-> Pilot/Staging is called as pre-production (Test application behaviour with live   data)

-> Production environment is used to deliver the project (Live Env)

-> If application is deployed to Prod environment end users can access the project.


Build & Deployment process
---------------------------
-> Developer(s) will commit code to repository

-> Take latest code from Repository

-> Compile source code

-> Code Review

-> Execute Junits

-> Package project

-> Deploy project to environment

Eariler admin team used to perform all the above steps manually. But now a days we are automating above steps using a tool called JENKINS.
